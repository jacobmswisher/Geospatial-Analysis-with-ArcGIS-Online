# Introduction to Geospatial Analysis with ArcGIS Online

Welcome to the curriculum homepage for the Introduction to Geospatial Analysis with ArcGIS Online Workshop.

This workshop provides an overview of basic tools for geospatial analysis available with ESRI's ArcGIS Online Platform.

It is assumed that before taking this workshop, you will have developed a basic knowledge of working with spatial data in ArcGIS Online. If you are new to Geographic Information Systems or ArcGIS Online, consider completing the [Mapping with ArcGIS Online Workshop](https://github.com/jacobmswisher/ArcGIS-Online) before learning about Geospatial Analysis in this workshop.

**Note: This workshop was developed for ArcGIS Online's Map View Classic. At the time of the latest commit, not all tools for Geospatial Analysis are available in the new Map Viewer. The curriculum will be updated at a later date following the migration of all analysis tools used in this workshop to the new Map Viewer.**

Time: 2 hours
