# Part 5: Practicum

Now that you have learned how to conduct a few basic operations with vector data and know how to create joins using ArcGIS Online, it's time to put your new skills into practice in the following scenario.

To complete the task below, you will need to use the following datasets that you uploaded to ArcGIS Online at the beginning of this workshop:
1. Indiana_Counties.shp
2. Indiana_Roads.shp
3. Possible_Restaurant_Sites.shp
4. Site_Costs.csv

## Scenario

You are a GIS specialist who has contracted with a local restaurateur who is trying to decide on a location for their next establishment. The restaurateur needs to present viable locations for a new restaurant in northern Indiana to their business partners next week, who the restaurateur says are visual learners. They have given you information about possible sites for a new restaurant as well as information from their real estate agent about the purchase price of each site and would like you to create a map for their business presentation of restaurant sites that meet the following criteria:

1. Site cost of less than $500,000
2. Site not within 3 miles of a major highway

Additionally, the business partners will want to know which county each site is in so that they can assess the tax implications of opening a new restaurant for each possible site. The restaurateur would like the map you create of possible sites to symbolize (color) each site based on the county in which it is located.

If needed, you can find a sample workflow to solve this problem [here](https://github.com/jacobmswisher/Geospatial-Analysis-with-ArcGIS-Online/blob/main/Sections/Part6.md#practicum).
